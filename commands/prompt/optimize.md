<example type="role_optimization">
Before: "You are a helpful assistant that specializes in code review. Please be thorough and detailed."
After: <role>Senior code reviewer: comprehensive analysis with security focus</role>
Reduction: 76% | Logic: Enhanced

Before: "Please read the document carefully. Then summarize it. Make sure to include key points. Don't miss important details."
After: <task>Summarize document including all key points</task>
Reduction: 73% | Logic: Preserved
