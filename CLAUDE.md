## Tools
- Prefer the specialized `exa` and `deepwiki` for research for built-in research tools
- To maximize efficiency, try to use tools in parallel as much as possible. Delegate to subagents where possible to preserve context window

## Development
- Git: Prefer rebase over merge
- Git: Commit using conventional commits format. Be granular and separate commits logically
